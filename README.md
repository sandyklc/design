# Design
This repository is for requesting design work from Launch Pad's designers and tracking progress on design work.

## Process for Developers
When your team requires design work, create an issue in this repository outlining all your requirements and put it in the `Triage` pipeline in ZenHub. A designer will assign themself to the issue and either begin working on it or ask for clarification. Once the designs are ready, the designer will ask you to review them, at which point you can request changes if necessary.

## Process for Designers
When a new issue is added to the `Triage` pipeline, check to make sure it has enough information. If you require more information or clarifications, move the issue to the `Blocked` pipeline and add a comment to the issue explaining what information you're missing and `@mention` the person who created the issue. Once the request is clear, move the issue to `In Progress` and begin designing! If at any point you require clarification, move the issue back to `Blocked` and comment again. Once the designs for an issue are complete, move the issue to `Review` and request a review from the issue creator.
